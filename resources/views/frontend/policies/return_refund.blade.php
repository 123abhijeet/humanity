        Refund Policy
    </h3>
    <br>

    <p>
        When you buy our products/services, your purchase is not entitled for any refund. If you buy any online batch/service, it is non-refundable. If you purchase any batch by mistake, you can request to change it to another batch of the same amount within 10 days of the purchase. We recommend you to first check the complete system and then decide to make a payment in case of books. If the product received is damaged/lost by the courier partner, the student is entitled for a replacement. However, in case of wrong address given or books not accepted by students the purchase will not be entitled for any kind of refund.
